## Code Book describing the variables in the GroupedMeanData.txt dataset

*A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

*Here are the data for the project:

* The final dataset called GroupedMeanData.txt has 180observations and 68 columns(variables) with the following names, the whole data is being grouped by activity and subject variables (each combination for 1 level of activity and 1level of subject), where the other variables are basically the average values for each of the previously mentioned combination, in order to fully understand the data I recommend to visit the link I have provided above
